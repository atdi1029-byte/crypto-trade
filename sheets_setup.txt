Crypto Trade Dashboard — Google Sheet Setup
============================================

1. CREATE A NEW GOOGLE SHEET
   Name it: "Crypto Trade Tracker" (or whatever you want)

2. CREATE THESE TABS (exact names):
   - Signal Log
   - Positions
   - Dashboard
   - Config
   - Performance

3. TAB HEADERS:

   Signal Log (Row 1):
   Timestamp | Symbol | Signal | Entry | SL | TP1 | TP2 | MACD | Volume | Cross | In Zone | RSI | Timeframe | Score | Raw JSON

   Positions (Row 1):
   Timestamp | Symbol | Signal | Entry | SL | TP1 | TP2 | Score | Action | Outcome | Realized PnL

   Dashboard (Row 1):
   Symbol | Total Trades | Wins | Losses | Win Rate | Last Signal | Last Price | Avg RR | Open Positions

   Config (Row 1 + values in Row 2):
   A1: max_positions    A2: 3

   Performance (leave empty — rebuilt on demand)

4. DEPLOY APPS SCRIPT:
   - Extensions → Apps Script
   - Delete default code, paste contents of apps_script.gs
   - Deploy → New deployment → Web app
   - Execute as: Me
   - Who has access: Anyone
   - Copy the deployment URL

5. UPDATE DASHBOARD:
   - Open Crypto/index.html
   - Replace 'YOUR_APPS_SCRIPT_URL' with your deployment URL (two places: API_URL and POST_URL)

6. UPDATE TRADINGVIEW:
   - Set your crypto indicator webhook URL to the deployment URL
   - Alerts should send JSON with: signal, symbol, entry, sl, tp1, tp2, macd, volume, cross, in_zone, rsi, timeframe

7. TEST:
   - Visit deployment URL with ?action=dashboard → should return JSON
   - Open index.html → should show empty dashboard
   - Fire a test alert → signal should appear
